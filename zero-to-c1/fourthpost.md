Hello again,

It's been a while hasn't it? Too long. My excuse? Well. I don't really have one. Not a good one anyway.

### Excuses, excuses...

I've just started a summer job as an au pair in Austria and, well, nobody told me it was so full-on. I had expected to be able to do at least 3-4 hours of French each day in my downtime but all I want to do in my downtime is sleep. Because of that, for many days I was getting less than an hour of French in every day, which is not enough if I want to be C1 by February.

### The solution

This state of affairs is not something that pleases me, so I decided to change it. I made a very good friend from the US of A while working in Austria and it turns out that he's currently trying to learn Japanese and Latin but also found himself lacking motivation to do it. We came up with the idea that every day, we should send what we want to accomplish for that day. If the person hasn't sent proof of finishing the self-assigned task, then you have to send the other person 10$. This has resulted in me sending my good friend about 6 or 7 screenshots a day, while he sends me pictures of Latin in his notebook. This is the ultimate motivational system for me because I'm tight as anything and don't want to give up money at any cost. This way, I work or I lose my precious. Easy choice there.


À bientôt,
Luke
