Well, hello. Or should I say bonjour.

## Updates

I've been reluctantly putting off writing this blog as I was waiting for things to fall into place here in Montpellier, which they seemed to have done and so I could no longer put off writing something here.

## A place to call home

The main problem I've had while being here is finding somewhere to live. It's incredibly difficult for anyone to find anywhere to live here and I've encountered many Frenchmen and women struggling in this same pursuit. Now imagine how hard it is for someone who is only going to be in this city for 3 and a half months and has a limited knowledge of French to find somewhere. In addition, the prices here in Montpellier are ridiculously high, that is, much higher than in England. I went to see one "room" that was advertised at 360€ plus charges (but not including bills, which are also very expensive here. The room consisted of a wooden platform with a mattress on top. The distance between the mattress and the ceiling was less than a metre, meaning that I would have whacked my head everytime I'd woken up, and that's if I'd even gotten the place.

Luckily, I have a friend in Montpellier with a very generous family. For my 3 or so months here I will be staying in a self-enclosed flat underneath where they live, which is far and away the best offer I've had. I am, of course, paying rent but it is more than reasonable. I'm just glad I'm not in the same situation as one Spanish translator I met, who had to pay 800€ for a single room for one month. Ridiculous.

Since ensuring I have somewhere to live, I've just been doing the normal bureaucracy necessary to enrol in a university course and getting a French phone number. You know, the usual.

## The course is coming

After being in Montpellier now for about 2 and a half weeks with no real structure, I am craving the beginning of the language course and learning French in earnest and in a more structured way than Anki flashcards have allowed me so far. I am also looking forward to getting to know new people from all over the globe and trying to speak exclusively French with them. It's always the struggle of the English native speaker to try and speak a foreign language. Yes, we have a terrible reputation for knowing foreign languages, but we can't change that if you don't let us try to speak your language!

Alright, enough of my ranting today.

Until next time,

À bientôt,
Luke
