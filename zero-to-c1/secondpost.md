Hello again,

Two days after my first post, I was considering what I could add to this little diary of mine to document my French learning experience. While procrastinating on doing French grammar, I decided to look at French music on youtube, as this had been really useful in me learning German, as long as nobody realises you're quoting a song. In that vain, I've decided to share my quite poorly researched list with you.

### Time to face the music

First of all, [Stromae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromae).
I currently have four of his songs in my playlist including;
* [Alors on danse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHoT4N43jK8), a song that just gets you bouncing and the only French song I was vaguely aware of prior to looking properly.
* [Papaoutai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbR5EHHSfx4), a song about Stromae's loss of his father, really well-crafted.
* [Tous les memes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAMWdvo71ls), I'm still getting to understand this song but damn it's catchy.
* [Formidable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_xH7noaqTA), my favourite song my Stromae. It's about a guy that's lost a girl. It's also a great way to work on to be in the imperfect tense ;).

Secondly, the quite enchanting [Indila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indila)

I played Indila to my mother and she asked if it was Bollywood. Spoiler. It's not. But I can certainly understand where my Mum was coming from, as Indila's song do seem to have a Bollywood...beat running through them. She does describe herself as a child of the world with a particular affinity for India. Anyway, on with the songs.
* [Dernière Danse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5KAc5CoCuk), by far Indila's most famous song. I just really like it, she's got a nice voice and the French language sounds very enticing when she sings.
* [S.O.S](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sWJXK8AHlI), not my favourite of her but still definitely worth a mention.
* [Love Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF3XjEhJ40Y), an English title but a French song. It's a good'en.
* Finally, [Tourner dans le vide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtNJMAyeP0s), roughly translated as turning through the void/emptiness. This song does have a bit more of a depressing vibe about but has a good story behind it. She speaks of the superficial world she must face after her love left and how she feels she is just turning through a void.

There are more artists I could mention but to be honest I don't know their songs well enough yet to comment on them so I may include them in a later entry. The above songs are my favourite so far.

Back in a couple of days with more,

À bientôt,
Luke
