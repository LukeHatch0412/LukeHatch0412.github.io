Greetings from France!

I am very lucky to have a very good friend from France and even luckier that they can tolerate sharing a house with me for a few days while I live it up. I'm currently in the southern French city of Montpellier, famous mainly for its wines. Reflections on the city so far are that it is slightly run down but in a kind of charming French way that makes it okay and my second observation is that it is well hot. I was doing some French exercises at midnight last night and the temperature was still 29 degrees celsius. No thank you. I've been advised to enjoy early mornings and evenings and to sleep during the afternoon. I'm finally understanding the Spanish siesta.

However, before and while in Montpellier I've made a couple of faux pas. The first was fairly minor and perhaps even understandable as just a cultural difference. A friend of my friend was letting me into Paul's (my friend) house. She turned the corner and we greeted each other. She leans in for the three "kisses" favoured by this area. Bam! Luke throws out his hand for a handshake. I had completely forgotten that the French have this tradition and having been in Austria where handshaking is also the norm, it just hadn't occurred to me. She looked at me a little strangely but knew I was English and I hope wasn't offended. I don't think she was.

The second was one I only realised 10 minutes after the event. I flew this morning into Nîmes Airport, around 45 minutes from Montpellier. In order to get to Montpellier I needed to first get a shuttle from the airport to Nîmes and then a further train to Montpellier. Upon boarding the bus, I confidently said "la gare". Now, that would have been fine. The correct pronunciation of gare is something like "gar" in English, but with a French R. What I said, however, was "ger". Unfortunately, this does have a meaning in French, war. Although spelt differently, la guerre means the war. This means that I went onto a shuttle bus in France, when the driver knew I was English, and just said "**the war**". Thankfully, past a slightly strange look, I think the driver understood I was just a fool and sold me a ticket. 

Just this today to give you a taster of what an idiot I make and will continue to make of myself in order to learn French.

À Bientôt!
Luke
