Well, hello there. My name's Luke Hatch and I hope to be making many more entries into this blog in the coming months. A few days ago, I begun learning French. Strictly speaking, I have learnt French to a low level before, but haven't spoken a word for a good 8 years now. After a change of circumstances, I have decided that I want to work in International Security and, as many of the biggest world institutions work in both English and French, I figured it would be a good idea to relearn the language of love. On this blog, I'll be sharing resources that I'm using and hopefully taking tips and receiving feedback. I also wanted to write something that would document the different stages of my development. I guess that's all folks.


## What have I been doing thus far?

I've been actively learning French for the past couple of days and have been using a few resources to do it. 

Firstly, I'd like to very much thank the poster of [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/7j37er/0_to_c1_in_a_year_lessons_learned/), who has given me a blueprint of how I can achieve a great level of French in very little time. Consequently, I have used a couple of resources on this redditor's recommendation. 

### Materials
* I've been doing some exercises in Easy French Step-by-Step, by Myrna Bell Rochester, which is available to buy [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/French-Step-Step-Myrna-Rochester/dp/0071453873/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1EHJOXZEDS5YY&keywords=easy+french+step-by-step&qid=1561752526&s=gateway&sprefix=easy+french%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-1) from Amazon.
* I've also been perusing the [TV5Monde langue Française section](https://langue-francaise.tv5monde.com/?utm_source=tv5monde&utm_medium=metanav&utm_campaign=langue-francaise) and using their very useful news videos to brush up on my listening skills.
* I am also a fan of the [Coffee Break French podcast](https://radiolingua.com/coffeebreakfrench/), which has helped me remember a lot of my lost French in bitesize and manageable chunks. Additionally, the Glaswegian accents alone make it a pleasant listen.

That's all I've got to report so far, but I hope to be updating the blog with progress every couple of days, including resources and bad French as I do it.

À bientôt!

Luke
