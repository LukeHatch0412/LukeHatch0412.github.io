Me again.

I'm writing an update because after being in France for around a month, my language course has finally started!

### What's the situation?

I took the placement test around two weeks ago now and was shocked to discover that I'd been put in the B2 group. Since I hadn't studied French in any structured way for about 8 years, I was shocked with the diagnosis. However, after attending the class, I decided I was in the right group. I'm positive I still have lots of gaps in my French, but my communicative ability is good enough for the group, as is my listening comprehension, which is something I had been worried about. 

This having been said, I am also absolutely positive that there are many in the group who are much better at French than me. This is a fairly new experience for me as I consider languages to be one of my strong points. Of course, I was shocked to be in this group for French and I was more than prepared to be one of the worst in this class. While I thought this would be a difficult position to be in, I've actually found it to be quite liberating. I'm not at all afraid of making mistakes because people expect them from me. I've also found friends in the group who are not afraid to tell me when my "ou" sound sounds nothing like French. It seems I've fallen on my feet.

The challenge now will be trying to keep up French revision while doing the language course at the same time. I'm always tired by the end of the day and am often passing up opportunities to revise. I'll let you know in the next post if and how I overcome this.

À bientôt,
Luke
